## The 20 New Prompting & Tactics Topics

### Group 1: Prompt Structure & Mechanics (5 topics)

These cover the fundamentals of how to build better prompts

1. **The one-line prompt that unlocked 60% better AI outputs**
   - Focus: Constraint-based prompting for dramatic improvements
   - Angle: Sometimes less is more, one perfect line beats verbose instruction

2. **How to talk to AI like you talk to a contractor (and get 10x better results)**
   - Focus: Conversational clarity over technical jargon
   - Angle: Treating AI like a real human contractor improves quality

3. **The prompt template I use for every business automation**
   - Focus: Repeatable system for consistent AI outputs
   - Angle: Template-based approach = reliability and speed

4. **Why your AI outputs are mediocre (and how to fix it in 30 seconds)**
   - Focus: Common mistakes and quick fixes
   - Angle: Most failures are fixable, not AI's fault

5. **The 5-part prompt framework that transforms generic to genius**
   - Focus: Structured approach to prompt design
   - Angle: Framework > chaos, system > freestyle

### Group 2: Advanced Concepts (5 topics)

These dive deeper into psychological and technical tricks

6. **How context beats complexity in AI prompts**
   - Focus: Context matters more than detailed instructions
   - Angle: Give AI the full picture, not a checklist

7. **The constraint that made my AI outputs 100x more useful**
   - Focus: Strategic limitations improve quality
   - Angle: Paradox: constraints make outputs better, not worse

8. **Why you should never ask AI yes-or-no questions (and what to ask instead)**
   - Focus: Question framing has massive impact
   - Angle: Open-ended beats binary, every time

9. **The prompt pattern that keeps AI focused on what actually matters**
   - Focus: Maintaining focus and relevance
   - Angle: AI needs help staying on track

10. **How to debug a broken prompt (before you blame the AI)**
    - Focus: Systematic troubleshooting
    - Angle: Most "bad AI" is actually bad prompts

### Group 3: Advanced Techniques (5 topics)

These are higher-level tactics for solving complex problems

11. **The system prompt hack that changed my AI game**
    - Focus: System-level prompt engineering
    - Angle: System prompts are more powerful than most people realize

12. **Why "be more detailed" is the worst prompt advice (and what actually works)**
    - Focus: Counterintuitive guidance
    - Angle: Conventional wisdom is often wrong

13. **The role-play prompt that makes AI think like your ideal employee**
    - Focus: Character-based prompting
    - Angle: AI performs better when given a role/persona

14. **How to use examples in prompts to get exactly what you want**
    - Focus: Few-shot prompting techniques
    - Angle: Examples beat explanations

15. **The iterative prompt technique that fixes 80% of bad outputs**
    - Focus: Refinement loop rather than one-shot
    - Angle: Second pass usually fixes what first pass missed

---

### Group 4: Expert Tactics (5 topics)

These are advanced, nuanced approaches for maximum results

16. **Why specificity matters more than length in prompts**
    - Focus: Quality over quantity in instructions
    - Angle: A specific 50-word prompt beats vague 500-word prompt

17. **The output format trick that eliminates AI hallucinations**
    - Focus: Structured outputs reduce errors
    - Angle: Format specification = accuracy

18. **How to chain prompts to solve problems AI cannot solve alone**
    - Focus: Multi-step prompt sequences
    - Angle: Complex problems need complex solutions, use chaining

19. **The prompt that turned my AI from assistant to strategist**
    - Focus: Elevating AI capability through prompting
    - Angle: Same AI, completely different level through better prompts

20. **Why you should debate with your AI (and how to do it right)**
    - Focus: Iterative refinement through dialogue
    - Angle: Push back, challenge, improve through conversation

## What Makes These Different From Old Topics

### OLD (Scrapped)
- ❌ "The prompting strategy that changes everything" (vague)
- ❌ "Why generic AI outputs fail" (explains problem, not solution)
- ❌ "The prompt structure that actually works" (generic)
- ❌ "Prompting frameworks every business owner should know" (list-based)

### NEW (Live)
- ✅ "The one-line prompt that unlocked 60% better AI outputs" (specific hack)
- ✅ "How to talk to AI like you talk to a contractor" (unique angle)
- ✅ "The role-play prompt that makes AI think like your ideal employee" (specific technique)
- ✅ "The system prompt hack that changed my AI game" (concrete tactic)

**Difference:** New topics are specific, actionable, and teach actual techniques
