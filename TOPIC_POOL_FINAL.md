## Archive: What Was Scrapped

The 5 old prompting topics that were replaced:

- ❌ "The prompting strategy that changes everything"
- ❌ "Why generic AI outputs fail (and how to fix it)"
- ❌ "The prompt structure that actually works for business"
- ❌ "How to get consistent results from AI every time"
- ❌ "Prompting frameworks every business owner should know"

**Reason:** Too generic, not specific enough, didn't show your unique expertise

**Replacement:** 20 specific, actionable, results-focused tactics that show mastery

## Final Word

Your content is now positioned to clearly communicate:

> **"I don't just use AI. I've mastered it. Here are the specific techniques I use to get 100x better results. Here's how real businesses are implementing these. Here's where the market is heading. Here's my authentic story. Here's how these principles apply to your specific industry."**

This is significantly stronger than generic "how to prompt" content.
