## HOOK TESTING FRAMEWORK

### How to Test Which Hooks Work for Your Audience

1. **Write 5 hooks for every post**
   - Variation matters; test different angles
   - Pick the strongest after review

2. **Track performance in first 30 min**
   - Early engagement signals algorithm boost
   - Adjust if launching future posts

3. **Monitor comment quality**
   - Meaningful conversation > vanity likes
   - Comments show true hook resonance

4. **A/B test over 4-week cycles**
   - Test one hook type for 4 posts
   - Compare engagement rates
   - Identify winner; scale

5. **Double down on winners**
   - If curiosity hooks get 3x comments, use more
   - Personal voice matters; borrow framework, not exact words

---

## RED FLAG HOOKS TO AVOID

These get scrolled past or trigger negative reactions:

- ❌ "I'm so grateful for..."
- ❌ "Excited to share..."
- ❌ "As a thought leader..."
- ❌ "If you're reading this, it was meant for you"
- ❌ "Humble brag" openings
- ❌ "Please read this" (begging)
- ❌ "Don't miss this" (FOMO manipulation)
- ❌ "Like if you agree" (desperate engagement)
- ❌ Generic industry phrases ("synergy," "leverage," "win-win")
- ❌ All caps (except ironic emphasis)

---

## FINAL INSIGHT: THE HOOK HIERARCHY

**For maximum impact, use this priority order:**

1. **Specific over generic** (72 people > many people)
2. **Emotional before tactical** (how it felt > what it meant)
3. **Question over statement** (invites thinking > declares truth)
4. **Contrarian over confirming** (challenges > validates existing beliefs)
5. **Concrete over abstract** (showed up at conference > built network)

**The best hook for you:** Write 5 different angles. Pick the one that makes YOU want to click "see more."

If it works for you, it'll work for others.
