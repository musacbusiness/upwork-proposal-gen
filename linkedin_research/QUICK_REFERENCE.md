## THE WINNING POST STRUCTURE (Copy & Use)

```
[HOOK - 1-2 SENTENCES]
Stop-scrollable statement. Create curiosity, challenge assumptions, or spark emotion.
✓ Specific number, contrarian take, surprising fact, or relatable struggle
✗ Generic statement, vague promise, corporate language

[CONTEXT - 2-3 SENTENCES]
Brief situation setup. Why should reader care?
✓ Emotional validation, acknowledgment of shared struggle
✗ Lengthy backstory, irrelevant details

[PROBLEM/STORY - 3-5 SENTENCES]
Dive into the struggle. Make reader FEEL it.
✓ Specific example, honest struggle, real detail
✗ Generic problem statement, artificial drama

[THE SHIFT - 2-3 SENTENCES]
What changed? What did you realize?
✓ The turning point, the realization, the action taken
✗ Lecture tone, preaching

[LESSON - 1-2 SENTENCES]
One clear takeaway. Make it memorable.
✓ Actionable, specific, earned from the story
✗ Generic advice, five lessons crammed in

[VISUAL BREAK]
Use formatting for scannability:
• Bullet points
• Numbers
• **Bold text**
• Line breaks

[CTA - 1 SENTENCE]
Question. Invitation. Not demand.
✓ "What's your take?" / "Disagree? Let's talk." / "Yes or no?"
✗ "Like and comment" / "Share this post"
```

## COMMON MISTAKES & FIXES

### Mistake: Generic opening
❌ "LinkedIn is a powerful platform."
✅ "I've wasted 2 years on LinkedIn doing it wrong."

### Mistake: No personal experience
❌ "Posting frequently helps grow your network."
✅ "I tried daily posting for 90 days. Then I cut back to 2x per week. Results doubled."

### Mistake: Five lessons crammed in
❌ "Here are 5 ways to succeed: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5..."
✅ "I learned one thing this year. Everything else was noise. Here it is:"

### Mistake: Disappearing after posting
❌ Post, then ghost
✅ Post, then reply to every comment for first hour

### Mistake: "Like and comment if you agree"
❌ "Drop a comment below!"
✅ "Do you disagree? Tell me why."

### Mistake: Emoji spam
❌ "I'm so 🙌 excited 🚀 to share 🌟 this amazing 💡 insight! ✨"
✅ "I'm excited to share this insight." (No emoji or 1 max)

## WRITING TIPS (In 60 Seconds)

1. **Hook first** - Make first 2 sentences stop scrolling
2. **Story before solution** - Emotional resonance before advice
3. **Be specific** - 72 people, not "many"; January 2024, not "recently"
4. **One idea** - Don't try to teach 5 things
5. **Short sentences** - Especially in hook. (Like. This.)
6. **Question everything** - "Is this specific?" "Does this feel authentic?" "Would I click 'see more'?"
7. **Read aloud** - Does it sound like you?

---

## THE ONE-MINUTE POST TEST

Can you answer "YES" to all these?

1. **Would I click "see more" on this hook?**
2. **Does it sound like something I'd say in conversation?**
3. **Is there a specific moment/story (not just ideas)?**
4. **Does it have one clear takeaway?**
5. **Does the CTA invite real dialogue (not begging for likes)?**

**All yes?** Post it.
**Any no?** Fix it first.

---

## TOOLS TO USE

- **LinkedIn Editor:** Write and preview before posting
- **Hemingway App:** Check for readability (aim for "Grade 9-10")
- **Voice-to-text:** Read your post aloud; sounds natural?
- **Your network:** Show 1 person before posting; get feedback
- **Analytics:** Track what works; double down

---

## REMEMBER

**The algorithm doesn't make viral content.**
**Your audience makes viral content.**
**Your job: Give them something worth sharing.**

Be specific. Be real. Be helpful.
Everything else is secondary.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Pick one hook type** from this sheet
2. **Write your next post** using the structure
3. **Test it on yourself** (would you read it?)
4. **Post at optimal time** (Tue-Thu, 7-8am or 5-6pm)
5. **Be present first hour** (reply to every comment)
6. **Analyze results** using benchmarks
7. **Double down on what works**

That's it. Repeat.

**Bookmark this page. Reference before every post. Watch your engagement improve.**

Good luck.
