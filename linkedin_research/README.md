## Key Insights Across All Files

### The Core Formula for Success
```
Original Insight × Authentic Voice × Strong Hook × Early Engagement × Author Presence = Reach
```

### The High-Engagement Post Has:
1. Specific hook (1-2 sentences that stop scrolling)
2. Emotional connection (validates reader's experience)
3. Unique perspective (only you would think/know this)
4. Clear structure (scannable, not wall of text)
5. Specific numbers (72 people, not "many")
6. Question-based CTA (invites conversation)
7. Author engagement (replies within first hour)

### What Kills Engagement:
- Generic advice (leveraging synergies...)
- No personal story (all facts, no experience)
- AI patterns (emoji frames, robotic structure)
- Disappearing after posting (no author engagement)
- Unclear CTA (what should reader do?)
- One-way broadcasting (not inviting dialogue)

### The Algorithm Rewards (2025):
- Original thinking over recycled advice
- Authentic voice over corporate polish
- Substantive engagement over vanity metrics
- Author presence over post frequency
- Quality over quantity

| Time to engagement | <90 min | Algorithm amplification window |
| Reach (24 hrs) | >5,000 | Successful distribution |
| Likes | 1,000+ | Strong post |
| Comments | 200+ | Very engaging |
