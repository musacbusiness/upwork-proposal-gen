═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Create a vertical (4:5 aspect ratio, 1080x1350px) LinkedIn video, EXACTLY 10 seconds
long, that demonstrates a time-saving AI prompt for business owners. FAST PACED.

SCENE 1 (0-2 seconds): HOOK - Immediate attention
- First frame: Bold white text centered on dark background: "This prompt saves me
  5 hours/week"
- Hands quickly typing on laptop visible in background
- NO voiceover - text only
- Energy: Urgent, captivating
- Goal: Stop the scroll in 2 seconds

SCENE 2 (2-5 seconds): PROBLEM + SOLUTION CONTRAST
- Split screen: Left side shows messy inbox (chaos), right side shows ChatGPT
  interface
- Quick cursor movement in inbox showing tedious manual work (time-lapsed)
- Text overlay fades in: "Manual: 2 hours" on left, "AI: 2 minutes" on right
- Arrow pointing from chaos to organized
- Organized JSON results appearing on right side with ✨ animation

SCENE 3 (5-8 seconds): THE PROOF
- Show dashboard with results animating in:
  "340 emails organized"
  "Auto-categorized"
  "Response templates ready"
- Text overlay: "The exact prompt inside"
- Keep it snappy, clean aesthetic

SCENE 4 (8-10 seconds): CTA
- Quick cut to person at desk with satisfied look
- Bold text overlay: "DM 'PROMPT' for template"
- Your LinkedIn handle appears
- Quick fade to black
- TOTAL TIME: 10 seconds exactly

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Vertical format: Must be 4:5 aspect ratio (1080x1350px)
- Duration: EXACTLY 10 seconds (no longer)
- Pacing: VERY fast cuts (0.5-2 second scenes), rapid transitions
- Text overlays: Large, bold, white text on dark/contrasting backgrounds
- Lighting: Natural, authentic (office/home setting with good window light)
- Audio: Minimal background music or silence - absolutely no voiceover
- Transitions: Quick fades or wipes between scenes
- Style: Professional but authentic - real tools, not generic stock footage
- Purpose: Hook hard and fast - 10 seconds is all you get to prove value

TESTING CHECKLIST FOR SORA OUTPUT:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Once Sora generates the video, check:

✅ HOOK (First 3 seconds)
  □ Does it immediately grab attention?
  □ Is text overlay clear and readable?
  □ Would someone watching muted understand the promise?

✅ FORMAT
  □ Is it truly vertical (4:5)?
  □ Does text fit on mobile screen without cutting off?
  □ Are scenes easy to follow without voiceover?

✅ AUTHENTICITY
  □ Looks like real tools/workflows (not generic)?
  □ Lighting appears natural (not overly produced)?
  □ Person/footage feels genuine, not corporate?

✅ PACING
  □ Does video maintain momentum with very fast cuts?
  □ Are scene transitions snappy (0.5-2 second duration)?
  □ Is it exactly 10 seconds (no longer)?

✅ CTA (Last 2 seconds)
  □ Is the action crystal clear (DM 'PROMPT')?
  □ Text large enough to read quickly?
  □ Feels direct but not pushy?

IF SORA DOESN'T NAIL IT ON FIRST TRY:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Try these refinement prompts:

REFINEMENT #1 - If text overlay isn't readable:
"Regenerate but with larger, bolder text overlays. Text should be easily readable
on a phone screen. Use high-contrast white text on dark backgrounds."

REFINEMENT #2 - If it feels too corporate/polished:
"Regenerate with authentic, less polished feel. Real office/home setup. Natural
lighting. Make it look like real work, not a commercial."

REFINEMENT #3 - If hook isn't compelling enough:
"Regenerate with more dramatic hook in first 2 seconds. The very first frame should
make someone stop scrolling. Use bold, high-contrast text."

REFINEMENT #4 - If it's longer than 10 seconds:
"Regenerate but MUST be exactly 10 seconds. Remove any slow moments. Make cuts
faster. Remove any voiceover or extra narration."

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Replace these with your actual tools/workflows:
- "ChatGPT" → "Claude" or "Gemini" (your actual AI tool)
- "customer emails" → "support tickets", "leads", "feedback" (your use case)
- "2 hours" → Your actual time saved
- "340 emails" → Your actual volume

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHY THIS PROMPT WORKS FOR LINKEDIN:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ 10 seconds = HIGHEST completion rate (5-15 second sweet spot per research)
✅ Hook in first 2 seconds = Stops the scroll before they even think
✅ Vertical 4:5 format = Maximizes mobile feed real estate
✅ Text-based = Works muted (80% watch with sound off)
✅ Before/After contrast = Instantly shows value proposition
✅ Authentic style = Builds trust vs overly polished ads
✅ Clear value = Business owners immediately understand ROI
✅ Direct CTA = One clear action (DM for template)
