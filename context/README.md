# Context Folder

This folder stores persistent context and session logs for your projects.

## Files

- **SESSION_LOG.md**: Full session history, decisions, and technical notes
- **README.md**: This file (explains the context folder purpose)

## How It Works

1. **Start of new chat:** Read `SESSION_LOG.md` to understand project history
2. **During session:** Update the log with decisions and actions
3. **End of session:** Log is current for next chat

**Folder name:** `context` (located at `/Users/musacomma/Agentic Workflow/context/`)
Please read the context folder at /Users/musacomma/Agentic Workflow/context/ to understand the project history and current state.
```

Or reference a specific project:
```
Read /Users/musacomma/Agentic Workflow/context/SESSION_LOG.md and continue where we left off on [project name].
```
