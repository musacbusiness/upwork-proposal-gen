## 1. Algorithm Fundamentals

### How LinkedIn Ranks Posts in 2026

LinkedIn ranks posts by **relevance, expertise, clarity, and early engagement**—not recency alone.

**The 3-Stage Distribution Process:**
1. **Quality Filtering** - LinkedIn checks if post meets quality standards
2. **Small-Audience Testing** - Shows to ~10% of your network first
3. **Content Relevance Scoring** - If engagement is high, expands reach

### The Golden Hour
**First 60-90 minutes** determine whether LinkedIn expands your post's reach. Early engagement (especially comments) signals "this post is worth showing to more people."

### What the Algorithm Rewards
| ✅ Rewards | ❌ Penalizes |
|------------|--------------|
| Native content (no external links) | External links in post body |
| Meaningful comments | Engagement pod activity |
| High dwell time (people reading) | Overly promotional content |
| Expert-led frameworks & insights | Generic/low-value content |
| Carousels, documents, native video | Posts with <3 or >5 hashtags |

### Key Statistics
- Posts with images: **2.3x more engagement** than text-only
- Carousels: **24.42% engagement rate** vs 6.67% for text
- Comments are **worth more than likes** in algorithm scoring
- Native videos: **20x more shares** than other content types

## 2. Post Structure

### Anatomy of a High-Performing Post

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HOOK (First 2 lines - 210 characters before "See more")    │
│ This determines if people expand your post                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ BODY (Value delivery - 800-1300 characters optimal)        │
│ • Line breaks for readability                              │
│ • Bullet points for scanability                            │
│ • Specific examples and numbers                            │
│ • Story arc or framework structure                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ CTA (Call-to-action - soft or direct)                      │
│ Ask for engagement OR drive to booking                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ HASHTAGS (3-5 relevant hashtags)                           │
│ #AI #Automation #BusinessGrowth #Productivity #Leadership  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Character Limits & Recommendations

| Element | Limit | Optimal |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Total post | 3,000 chars | 1,000-1,500 chars |
| Hook (before "See more") | 210 chars | 150-200 chars |
| Hashtags | 30 max | 3-5 |
| Image alt text | 120 chars | Full 120 chars |

### Formatting Best Practices

**DO:**
- Use generous line breaks (white space)
- Break up walls of text
- Use bullet points sparingly (3-5 max)
- Keep paragraphs to 1-2 sentences
- Use emojis strategically (1-3 per post)

**DON'T:**
- Write long paragraphs
- Use more than 5 hashtags
- Include external links in post body
- Overuse emojis (looks unprofessional)
- Write in ALL CAPS

### Post Length by Purpose

| Purpose | Length | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Quick tip | 500-800 chars | Fast value, high reach |
| Story/lesson | 1,000-1,300 chars | Dwell time + engagement |
| Framework/guide | 1,300-2,000 chars | Authority building |
| Carousel | 8-12 slides | Deep engagement |

## 3. Writing Frameworks

### Primary Frameworks for Lead Generation

#### 1. **PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)**
*Best for: Pain point awareness, service positioning*

```
[PROBLEM] Most business owners spend 10+ hours/week on tasks AI could handle.

[AGITATE] That's 520 hours/year. Two full months of your life.
Spent on emails, scheduling, data entry, reports.
While competitors are automating and scaling.

[SOLUTION] The fix isn't hiring more people.
It's building systems that work while you sleep.
One automation can reclaim 5+ hours every week.

Which task would you automate first? 👇
```

#### 2. **AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)**
*Best for: Longer posts, authority building*

```
[ATTENTION] I just saved a client $47,000/year with a single automation.

[INTEREST] Here's what happened:
They had 3 people manually processing invoices.
8 hours/day. Human errors. Delayed payments.

[DESIRE] We built one workflow that:
→ Extracts invoice data automatically
→ Validates against PO numbers
→ Routes for approval
→ Triggers payment

Total build time: 6 hours.
ROI: First month.

[ACTION] If you're still doing manually what software could do automatically,
let's talk. Link in comments.
```

#### 3. **BAB (Before → After → Bridge)**
*Best for: Transformation stories, case studies*

```
[BEFORE] 6 months ago, I was drowning in client work.
80-hour weeks. No time for strategy. Reactive mode 24/7.

[AFTER] Today, I work 40 hours. Revenue is up 60%.
I take Fridays off. My team runs without me.

[BRIDGE] What changed? I built systems.
Not complicated ones. Simple automations that handle the repetitive stuff.

Here are the 3 that made the biggest difference:
[List frameworks/systems]

Which one would help your business most? 👇
```

#### 4. **The Contrarian Hook**
*Best for: Thought leadership, standing out*

```
[CONTRARIAN] Unpopular opinion: Most "productivity tips" are garbage.

Wake up at 5am? Doesn't matter if you waste the morning on email.
Time blocking? Useless if your calendar controls you.
Inbox zero? Who cares if you're doing the wrong work?

Here's what actually moves the needle:
[List of actual insights]

Agree or disagree? I want to hear it. 👇
```

#### 5. **The Framework Post**
*Best for: Authority building, saves & shares*

```
[HOOK] The 3-step system that helped me automate 80% of my admin work:

Step 1: The Audit
→ Track every task for one week
→ Mark which ones are repetitive
→ Calculate hours spent on each

Step 2: The Stack
→ Identify 5 tasks taking 2+ hours/week
→ Research automation tools for each
→ Start with the easiest win

Step 3: The Build
→ Create one automation per week
→ Document everything
→ Iterate based on results

Total time investment: 10 hours
Total time saved: 20+ hours/week

Save this for later. ♻️ Share if useful.
```

### Framework Selection Guide

| Audience Awareness | Best Framework |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Cold (don't know you) | PAS, Contrarian |
| Warm (follow you) | AIDA, Framework |
| Hot (engaged regularly) | BAB, Direct CTA |

## 4. Hook Templates

### The First 2 Lines Determine Everything

**90% of your post's performance depends on your opening line.**

The hook must appear **before the "See more" cutoff** (210 characters).

### Hook Categories & Templates

#### 1. **Curiosity Hooks**
```
"The #1 mistake I see business owners make with AI..."
"What nobody tells you about automation..."
"I've reviewed 200+ businesses. Here's the pattern I keep seeing..."
"This one change increased my productivity by 300%..."
```

#### 2. **Controversial/Contrarian Hooks**
```
"Unpopular opinion: [conventional wisdom] is wrong."
"Stop doing [common practice]. It's killing your growth."
"Everyone says [X]. I disagree."
"The advice you've been given about [topic] is outdated."
```

#### 3. **Story Hooks**
```
"Last week, a client asked me something that stopped me cold..."
"I almost made a $50,000 mistake..."
"3 years ago, I was working 80-hour weeks..."
"The worst business decision I ever made taught me..."
```

#### 4. **Number/Data Hooks**
```
"I analyzed 500 LinkedIn posts. Here's what works..."
"This automation saves businesses $47,000/year..."
"93% of [group] don't know this about [topic]..."
"I spent $10,000 testing this. Here's what I learned..."
```

#### 5. **Question Hooks**
```
"What would you do with an extra 10 hours/week?"
"Why do most automation projects fail?"
"Are you making this common AI mistake?"
"What's stopping you from scaling right now?"
```

#### 6. **Bold Claim Hooks**
```
"You don't need more employees. You need better systems."
"AI won't replace you. Someone using AI will."
"The businesses that thrive in 2026 will have one thing in common..."
"I can predict which businesses will fail. Here's how..."
```

#### 7. **Relatable Hooks**
```
"Raise your hand if you've ever [common frustration]..."
"If you've ever felt [emotion] about [topic], read this..."
"You're not alone if [common struggle]..."
"Most entrepreneurs won't admit this, but..."
```

### Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Number + Benefit | "3 automations that save me 10 hours/week" |
| Mistake + Consequence | "This AI mistake is costing you clients" |
| Story + Stakes | "I almost lost my biggest client. Here's why..." |
| Contrarian + Proof | "Hustle culture is a lie. Data proves it." |
| Question + Intrigue | "Why do 80% of automations fail?" |

## 5. Visual Guidelines

### Image Dimensions

| Format | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio | Best For |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Feed post (landscape) | 1200 x 627 px | 1.91:1 | Links, general |
| Feed post (portrait) | 1200 x 1350 px | 4:5 | Mobile-first, max real estate |
| Feed post (square) | 1200 x 1200 px | 1:1 | Consistent branding |
| Carousel slide | 1080 x 1080 px | 1:1 | Multi-slide content |
| Carousel (vertical) | 1080 x 1350 px | 4:5 | Mobile-optimized carousel |

### Image Design Best Practices

**Colors & Branding:**
- Use consistent brand colors across all posts
- High contrast for readability (especially on mobile)
- Avoid overly busy backgrounds
- Professional, clean aesthetic

**Text on Images:**

- Leave 60-80px padding from edges
- Contrast text against background

**What Works:**
- Bold statistics/numbers
- Simple diagrams/frameworks
- Before/after comparisons
- Headshots with text overlay
- Clean infographics

**What to Avoid:**
- Stock photos (look generic)
- Too much text (illegible on mobile)
- Low contrast (hard to read)
- Cluttered designs

### Carousel Best Practices

**Structure:**
1. **Slide 1**: Hook slide - compelling question/statement
2. **Slides 2-10**: Value delivery - one point per slide
3. **Final Slide**: CTA - clear next step

**Design Rules:**
- Consistent fonts, colors, margins throughout
- One key point per slide
- Large, readable text
- Progress indicators (e.g., "3/10")
- CTA on final slide

**Engagement Stats:**
- Carousels get **24.42% engagement** (vs 6.67% text)
- Each swipe = engagement signal
- 8-12 slides optimal
- Educational content performs best

## 6. Call-to-Action Strategies

### CTA Types for Lead Generation

#### Tier 1: Soft CTAs (Engagement Focus)
*Use for: Building audience, warming followers*

```
"What's your biggest challenge with [topic]? Drop it below 👇"
"Agree or disagree? Let me know in the comments."
"Save this for later ♻️"
"Tag someone who needs to see this."
"Which of these resonates most with you?"
```

#### Tier 2: Value CTAs (Lead Capture)
*Use for: Building email list, nurturing leads*

```
"I put together a free guide on this. Comment 'GUIDE' and I'll send it."
"Want my automation checklist? Drop a 🔥 below."
"I created a template for this. DM me 'TEMPLATE' for access."
"Free resource in the comments 👇"
```

#### Tier 3: Direct CTAs (Booking Calls)
*Use for: Converting warm audience to calls*

```
"If you want help implementing this, let's talk. Link in comments."
"Ready to automate your business? Book a call (link in first comment)."
"Want to see if this could work for you? DM me 'CALL'."
"I help [target audience] with [outcome]. Book a free strategy call below."
```

### CTA Placement Strategy

**In Post Body (Soft):**
```
Which automation would help your business most? 👇
```

**In First Comment (Direct):**
```
If you want help implementing these systems in your business,
I have a few spots open for strategy calls this month.

Book here: [calendly link]

No pitch. Just clarity on what's possible for your business.
```

### The 40/40/20 Rule for CTAs

| Post Type | CTA Type | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 40% Value posts | Soft (engagement) | Comments, saves |
| 40% Engagement posts | Soft (engagement) | Questions, opinions |
| 20% Promotional posts | Direct (booking) | Calls, leads |

**Key**: Only use direct "book a call" CTAs on 20% of posts. The other 80% should warm your audience.

### High-Converting CTA Examples

**For Consultants:**
```
"If you're a [target: business owner/founder/CEO] looking to [outcome: automate, scale, systematize]...

I help [target] go from [before state] to [after state] without [pain point].

DM me 'CALL' if you want to explore what's possible."
```

**For Service Providers:**
```
"I'm opening 3 spots for [service/offer] this month.

If you want:
→ [Benefit 1]
→ [Benefit 2]
→ [Benefit 3]

Comment 'INFO' and I'll send you the details."
```

**Soft Booking CTA:**
```
"Questions about any of this? Happy to chat.

Link to book a free 15-min call in my bio."
```
