## Why Images Work on LinkedIn (Psychology)

### Professional FOMO Effect
- LinkedIn users fear missing industry insights more than other platforms
- Visuals that convey actionable information perform better
- Users engage to appear knowledgeable to their network ("performative engagement")

### What Triggers LinkedIn Engagement
- **Relevance** - Direct connection between image and post topic
- **Clarity** - Message is immediately obvious without reading
- **Authority** - Images that communicate expertise or proof
- **Authenticity** - Real, unpolished often outperforms stock photos
- **Recognition** - Ability to recall content for 3+ days

## What Does NOT Work on LinkedIn

- ❌ Generic stock photos (low engagement)
- ❌ Overly polished, corporate-looking images
- ❌ Images disconnected from post topic
- ❌ Poor quality, blurry, or low resolution
- ❌ Images that feel staged or inauthentic
- ❌ Content purely for entertainment (this isn't TikTok)
- ❌ Clickbait images that don't match post

---

## Design Best Practices

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear focal point (where eye is drawn first)
- High contrast to stand out in feeds
- White space (breathing room)
- Not cluttered or overly busy

### Typography (If Using Text Overlays)
- Minimum 18pt font for readability in scroll
- High contrast text (dark on light, light on dark)
- Sans-serif fonts (more modern, readable)
- Limited text (key stat, quote, or question only)

### Resolution & Dimensions
- High resolution (sharp, clean appearance)
- Square 1200x1200px (takes up more feed real estate)
- Or portrait 1080x1350px
- Mobile-first design (80%+ viewing on mobile)

### Color Psychology
- Bold colors for attention-grabbing
- Professional color palettes (blues, greens, grays)
- Consistency in branding
- Avoid overly saturated or jarring colors

## Critical Insight: Relevance > Polish

The research reveals a crucial finding:

**LinkedIn users want relevant, authentic images that directly support the post topic. Generic "professional photography" that doesn't connect to the message underperforms.**

This is why current images may not be relating to posts - the image generation prompt isn't prioritizing relevance to the specific post content.

### Niche Posts (Real Estate, Social Media)

## Implementation Strategy

Based on this research, the new image prompt should:

1. **Prioritize relevance** - Image MUST directly relate to post topic
2. **Use authentic style** - Real people, real scenarios, not overly polished
3. **Apply psychology** - Show transformation, data, or proof
4. **Design for feed** - High contrast, clear focal point, readable text overlays
5. **Match topic type** - Different approach for tactics vs. case studies vs. trends
6. **Avoid generic** - No vague "professional" images
7. **Enable recall** - Image memorable enough to recall 3 days later

This will significantly improve image-to-post alignment and engagement.
