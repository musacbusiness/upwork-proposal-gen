## Sora 2 Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### What Works:
✅ **Specific visual descriptions** - Tell Sora exactly what to show
✅ **Scene-by-scene breakdown** - Clear progression and timing
✅ **Authentic details** - Real tools, realistic lighting, relatable problems
✅ **Action-oriented** - Show movement, transitions, progress
✅ **Text overlays** - Essential since no audio necessary
✅ **Time markers** - Help Sora understand pacing (0-3s, 3-10s, etc.)

### What to Avoid:
❌ **Overly polished/corporate** - Feels like an ad, people scroll past
❌ **Generic stock footage** - Inauthentic, low engagement
❌ **Long talking heads** - People watch video first 3 seconds, need hook
❌ **Complex animations** - Can look cheap or distract from message
❌ **Horizontal format** - Loses 40% of view on mobile
❌ **Voiceover-heavy** - Most LinkedIn users watch muted
